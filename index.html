      <img src="https://goo.gl/mbjddt" class="auth-image" alt="ME">

      <p>My passions are to travel, eat, and play with dogs. I have travelled to Thailand, Peru, and LA in this past year. In Thailand I visited Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Phuket. There I rode elephants, visited historic landmarks, and ate entirely too much noodles. While in Peru I practiced Muay Thai, went mountain biking, went surfing, ate guinea pig and alpaca. My visit to LA consisted of eating In-And-Out, trying the city's best tacos, and drinking far too much soju. </p>

      <p>In my spare time I love to move and stay active. Growing up I played soccer, football, basketball, and tennis. since I was little I also did martial arts, starting with Karate and Tae Kwon Do. This later evolved into strength and conditioning with body building, power lifting, and olypic lifting. At the end of 2016 I begin training in Muay Thai. It was a much more contact heavy sport and required a lot more tactical movements. Muay Thai is a sport that originiated in Thailand which requires the use of fists, shins, elbows, and knees.</p>
